# How I Built a Scalable Web Infrastructure for SmartShop
## Company overview
SmartShop is a fictional mid-sized retail company that has recently decided to expand its business by launching an online store. As they anticipate an increase in web traffic due to marketing campaigns and seasonal sales, SmartShop requires a robust and reliable web infrastructure to ensure smooth customer experiences. With minimal in-house IT staff and a limited budget, they seek a cost-effective solution that can be manually adjusted for growth as needed, providing high availability and essential security while keeping operational complexity low.
